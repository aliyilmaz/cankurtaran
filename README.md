## Lifeguard (Nature and Environmental Protection Mapping Project)

This project is developed to enable nature, urban, and monument protectors to make annotations on digital maps to report environmental issues and promote conservation efforts. Users can mark areas that need protection, report them to the relevant authorities, or try to find solutions themselves.

### What can be used to mark?

- Marking of Plant and Animal Population
- Marking of historical and archaeological remains
- Marking of disaster and environmental problems that threaten the settlements
- Marking of waste load causing environmental pollution
- Marking of areas to be protected
- Marking of Problems with City Planning
